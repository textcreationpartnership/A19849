            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:14438:3"/> mindes enter into the contemplation of their natures ſeeking out their ſecrete and hidden quallities, for as it profiteth vs little to knowe that GOD hath adorned and decked the earth with all kinde of Corne and Cattell, with hearbes, fruites, Plantes, and trees, except he had alſo taughte vs to knowe the natural quallities and vſe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, how ſome ſerue for foode and ſuſtenance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome for the helpe and cure of ſundrie diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes greefes and maladies, ſome for other neceſſarte purpoſe, &amp;c.

               <p>Iupiter is hote and moyſt, ſanguine, a friend and preſeruer of the lyfe and nature of man, maſculine, of the day, and is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the greateſt fortune.</p>
               <p>Mars is immoderately hote &amp; drie, cholerike, maſculine, and of the night euill, and the leſſe miſfortune.</p>
               <p>The Sunne is moderately hote and drye, maſculine, and of the day fortunate, by aſpect infortunate by corporall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction.</p>
               <p>Venus is cold and moyſt, temperate, flegmatick, feminine, of the night, of good nature, and is called the leſſe fortune.</p>
               <p>Mercury in all things is common and mutable, he is good with the good, and euill with the euill, with the Maſculine maſculine, with the Feminines feminine, hote with the hote, and moyſt with the moyſt, infortunate with the miſfortunes, and fortunate with the fortunes, eſpecially when he is ioyned or corporally applying vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or beholdeth them with ſome
<pb facs="tcp:14438:7"/> good aſpect.</p>
               <p>The Mone is likewiſe cold and moyſt: and albeit ſhee doe heate a little, yet ſhe doth moyſten more, ſhe doth chaunge her nature and qualitie according to the quarters, like as the Sunne doth thorowout the ſignes of the Zodiack, &amp; the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and parts of the yeare. She is alſo feminine, of the night, and fleugmatick, and ſendeth vnto vs the vertue and impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the other Planets: For al the influences of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er bodyes paſſing through her Circle, come finally vnto vs. And this may ſuffice for the nature of the Planets, howbeit I thinke it neceſſary alſo in this place to declare the nature of the head and tayle of the Dragon.</p>
               <p>The head of the Dragon is in all poyntes like to Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, good with the good Planets, and euill with the euill: for being ioyned with the good Planets, he doth increaſe their goodneſſe, and with the euill their malice.</p>
               <p>The tayle of the Dragon is contrary to the head, for he is euill with the good, and good with the euill, ſo that he doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the malice of the euill Planets, and in like maner doth hinder and let the goodneſſe of the good.</p>
               <p>All theſe Planets together with the heade and tayle of the Dragon, are noted and marked by their certayne characters as appeareth: Saturne, ♄. Iupiter, ♃. Mars, ♂. Sunne, ☉.

<pb facs="tcp:14438:8"/> Moone: which two ſignes are moſte neare vnto our Zenith or poynt ouer our heads, and haue their courſe the greateſt part of the ſommer. They do alſo accord and agree to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and qualities, as is already ſayd: for the Crabbe is cold and moyſt, nocturne or of the night, feminine and moueable as the Moone. And the Lyon is hote and drye, diurne or of the day, maſculine and fixed as the Sunne. Theſe two planets or lights, haue ech of them but one ſigne for their houſe, but the other fiue haue euery one two ſignes, whereof the one is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the diurne or day houſe, becauſe it is in ſuch a ſigne, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nocturne, or of the nighte, whiche ſhall be in ſuch a ſigne. That is to ſay, the day houſe ſhalbe in a diurne ſigne, and the night houſe in a nocturne ſigne.</p>
                  <p>Then Saturne being the higheſt of the other fiue, like as he is contrary vnto the two great Lights, being enemy vnto nature, and a corrupter of her workes, ſo hath he obtayned for his houſes, the two ſignes which do behold the Crabbe and the Lyon with perfect enmitie, that is to ſaye, with an oppoſition or contrary aſpect, as Capricorne and Aquarius, of the which Capricorne is the night houſe, and Aquarius the daye houſe. Contrariwiſe, Iupiter which is the father and friende of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, hath for his houſes Sagittarius and Piſces, whiche be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Lyon and the Crabbe with a trine aſpect, whiche is the aſpect of perfect amitie, of the which Sagittarius is the day houſe, and Piſces the night. And becauſe Iupiter doth follow next after Saturne, the one of his houſes are before the houſes of Saturne, and the other after. Mars following after hath for his houſes Aries, and the Scorpion, wherof Aries is the day houſe, and the ſcorpion the night houſe. Theſe two ſignes doe behold the Crabbe and the Lyon with a quartile aſpect, which is the aſpect of vnperfect enmitie, becauſe that Mars is not friend vnto Nature, neither ſo great an enemye as Saturne. Then followeth Venus, which being no enemye vnto Nature, neither ſo great a friend as Iupiter, hath for her houſes two ſignes, which beholde the houſes of the ſunne and Moone with an aſpect of vnperfite amitie, that is with a ſex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
<pb facs="tcp:14438:8"/> aſpect, as Taurus and Lybra: of the which, Taurus is the night houſe, and Lybra the day houſe. Mercury being the laſt of all, hath for his day houſe Gemini, and Virgo for his night houſe, the which do not behold the houſes of the Lights with any aſpect, becauſe that Mercury being alwayes muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, hee doeth alwayes accorde and agree with thoſe Planets with whome he is corporally ioyned. This dignitie is called the dignitie of the houſe, becauſe that when a Planet is in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one of them, he is like a Prince in his palace, commanding and is obeyd. Alwayes it is to be noted, that one diurnall or day planet, is of greater force in his diurnal or day houſe, then in his nocturnal or night houſe. In like maner muſt you iudge of the nocturnall or night planet. Vnto this dignitie becauſe it is the firſt and chiefeſt is attributed the number of fiue, and as this dignitie is the greateſt amongſt them, euen ſo when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny planet is in the oppoſite or contrarye ſigne, he is moſte vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, in ſo muche that when hee is in the oppoſite of his houſe, he is ſayd to be in his detriment or decay.</p>

And in that place hee is exalted, becauſe then hee beginneth to come toward the North, and then the dayes beginne to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and to exceede the night. But hee is abaſed and in his detriment or decay in the place where his enemye is exalted, that is in the xix degree of Libra, in the which place Saturne is exalted, as likewiſe Saturne throwne downe and abaſed in the xix degree of Aries: For as the ſunne is the preſeruer
<pb facs="tcp:14438:9"/> of Nature, and Saturne the ruine and decay: ſo are their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuations and decayes cleane contrary. In like ſorte doth it happen betweene Iupiter and Mars, for Iupiter is exalted in the xv. degree of the Crabbe, and abaſed in the lyke degree of Capricorne, and Mars is exalted in the 28 degree of Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corne, and abaſed in the lyke degree of the Crabbe. Venus hath her exaltation in the xxvii. degree of Piſces, and in the like degree of Virgo her fall. Mercury hath his fall in the xv. degree of Piſces, and his exaltation in the like degree of Virgo. Fynally, the Moone is exalted in the thyrde degree of Taurus, and abaſed in the lyke degree of Scorpio. The head and tayle of the Dragon are lykewiſe exalted in certain places, and abaſed in the contrary: For as the head is exalted in the third degree of Geminy, and the tayle in the thirde of Sagittary, ſo is the head there abaſed, and the tayle in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny. Thus it is to be ſeene, that the Planets haue their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altations in ſuch ſignes as doe beholde the ſignes of ſome one of their houſes with an aſpect of amitie, whiche is partlye the cauſe that they are fortunate in thoſe places, as ſhall be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after declared. And albeit the auncient Arabians haue placed the exaltation of the Planets in certayne perticuler degrees, of the ſignes, yet neuertheleſſe following the minde of Ptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mey, we will take the whole ſignes for the exaltation. The Planets then being in thoſe ſignes and degrees, doe ſhewe their force in ſo muche that if any be borne they being in the like degrees, they make him happy and fortunate, working the contrary when they are in their fall and decay.

The ſextill aſpect is when the ſenters of two Planettes are diſtant one from another by the 60 part of the Zodiack, which is in valure two ſignes or 60 degrees, wherefore this ſextill is called aſpect of vnperfect friendſhip, becauſe the Planets doe behold one another in that ſort, and doe onely agree by a certaine qualitie. The quadrat or quartill aſpect (alſo called a tetragon) comprehendeth betweene the ſenters of two Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets or celeſtial bodies, the fourth part of the crooked circle, which is in value 3 ſignes or 90 degrees, the which, becauſe the ſignes beholding one another by this aſpect are moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb facs="tcp:14438:15"/> of two qualities, therefore it is the aſpect of vnperfecte enmitie. The trine aſpect co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tayning the third part of the ſaid circle, which is 120 degrees, is called the aſpecte of perfite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie and loue, for that the ſignes beholding one another by the ſame, doe agree in all qualities. The oppoſition happeneth when the moytie or halfe of the Zodiack contayning 6 ſignes, or 180 degrees, is betweene the centures of the bodyes of the two Planets: the which is called the aſpect of perfite emni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or hatred, for ſo much as thoſe partes of the Zodiack which beholde one another with that aſpect, like vnto the diſpoſition of the heauen, they are directly contrary. Amongſt theſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects as <hi>Iulius Firmicus</hi> witneſſeth in the ſecond booke of his Mathematicks the 25 chapter: the ſextill, quadrat, and tryne aſpects are double, that is to ſay, a right and a left, taking the right for the hinder part, and the lefte for the fore parte: as if we would ſay, that Aries hath a right ſextill vnto Aquarius, and a left vnto Geminy. Likewiſe Aries hath a righte tryne vnto Sagittarius, and a left vnto Leo. In like ſort you muſte iudge of all the other aſpects. Theſe continue ſo long as the beames of the Planets doe indure, of the which aſpects there is alſo made applications and ſeparations, whiche are manye times taken for true aſpects.

Theſe circles or Radiations are diuers and different one from another, becauſe the one is great, and the other lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. For Saturne caſteth his beames circularlye, 9 degrees forward, and ſo much backward, wherefore the halfe deamiter of his radiall circle contayneth nyne degrees, and the whole deamiter 18. The Radial circle of Iupiter is of the ſame qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Venus and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury caſteth their circuler beames 7 degrees euerye waye in length, ſo their whole Deamitur is 14. Fynally the Moone ſendeth foorth her beames on euery ſide 12 degrees, for the halfe of her deamiter, and the whole contayneth 24 degrees. Then the right application of the Moone vnto Saturne by a ſextill aſpect, ſhall be when as betweene the centure of their two bodyes there is contained 49 degrees and 30 minutes, or at the moſt 54 degrees. The lefte application is, when as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the 2 centers is contayned 70 degrees 30 minuts, or at the leaſt 66 degrees, for ſo much as the moytie of the halfe deamiter of the Circle radyant of Saturne is 4 degrees 30 mynutes, and the halfe of the Circle of the Moone is ſixe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, if then theſe partes be ioyned together, which mounte vnto 10 degrees and 30 minutes, and taken from 60 degrees for the right application are added vnto the ſame number, for the left, the application will be eaſily found.

               <p>And now to come to the ſeparation it is to be vnderſtande, that it is when one planet doth leaue or depart from the aſpect of another, or from his coniunction by the ſpace of one onelye degree, and alwayes he is ſtill ſayd to be ſeperated vntill that he hath wholy left and is departed from the beames of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Alſo we doe ſaye that the Moone doth ſeparate herſelfe

                  <p>The ſuperiour or higheſt Planets are more waightye then the inferiour or lower. For Saturne is more waightye then Iupiter, Iupiter then Mars, Mars then the Sunne, the Sunne then Venus, Venus then Mercurye, and fynallye,
<pb facs="tcp:14438:17"/> Mercury is more heauier then the Moone. And they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led more waightie and heauye becauſe their motions are ſlower then of thoſe which are vnderneth them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this tranſlation doth alſo happen, when a light planet doth ioyne himſelfe corporallye or by aſpecte, vnto one that is more heauye then hee, and the ſame agayne, to one that is more heauier.

<pb facs="tcp:14438:18"/> vertue, is when a Planet being in his owne houſe, or in anye other of his dignities, beholdeth another which is combuct or retrograde: for that Planet becauſe of his imbeſtlitie which commeth by his Retrogradation or combuſtion, cannot holde or keepe the vertue which the other doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate or giue vnto him by his aſpect. As in the figure following is ſhowed, where Venus being combuſte in Taurus, rendreth vp to the Moone her vertue which ſhe did giue vnto her by a ſextill aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.

Finally, it will be profitable if he which yieldeth vp his vertu be in an angle: otherwiſe it is altogether vnprofitable. The yeelding or ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring vp of the Light is, when two planets which do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde one another with any aſpect, yet both of them do behold ſome other planet: for that planet doth gather their Lightes and doth caſt it back agayne, eyther to themſelues or to ſome other place of the Zodiack, as appeareth by the figure hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter placed.

As when Mercury is in the firſt houſe, the Moone in the thirde, Venus in the fift, Mars in the ſixt, the Sunne in the ninth, Iupiter in the eleuenth, and Saturne in the twelfth. Likewiſe when they are in the parte of their excenters furtheſt diſtante from the earth, the whiche is called their Aux or increaſe: and alſo

               <p>The force of the deurnall Planets is aduanſed when they are by day aboue the earth, and by night vnder, but the noctur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nal planets reioice to be by day vnder the earth, and by night aboue.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe when their motion is increaſed, or that they bee direct, or at the leaſt in their ſecond ſtation, then are they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate.</p>
               <p>The like agayne is, when they are in a ſextill trine, or at the leaſt in a quartill aſpect of good planets, as alſo whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are in the ſame degree and minute that the ſunne is, without any difference of longitude or latitude, or in a ſextill or tryne aſpect with the ſunne, and when they depart from combuſtion or from vnder the beames of the ſunne.</p>
               <p>Fynally, they are ſtrong and fortunate when they are free and without any aſpect of the malygn planets, or when they are in reception with the good.</p>

The Lord therefore of the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or of another houſe, is the planet which hath moſt digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or greateſt ſtrength in that place. If then thou deſire to know what planet is Lord of the aſcendent, looke what ſigne and what degree of the ſigne is in the beginning of the firſte houſe. If with that ſigne and that degree you doe enter into the table of the dignities of the planets, and place your Index vpon the degree of the ſigne found out, by and by vnder the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex, directlye vnder the lyne of the ſame ſhall appeare all the dignities of the planets, as for example, if a queſtion be oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed whoſe aſcendent is the fifte degree of Aries, &amp; you woulde know the Lord therof, placing your index vpon the fift degree of Aries in the table of the dignities of the Planets, I doe ſee the Sunne to bee exalted in Aries and therfore to haue foure vertues. Then you ſee that although the exaltation of the Sunne be in the 19 degree of Aries yet it ſtretcheth through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole ſigne as the exaltations of the other Planetes doe, hee hath alſo a dignitie of a triplicitie bycauſe the

If it ſtil happen that they be equall in dignities, then looke whiche of them is in degree moſt agreeable to his nature, as if it ſhoulde bee a maſculine planet in a maſculine degree, a feminine in a femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine, or in a light, darke, deepe, voyd, azemene, or degrees that doth increaſe fortune, then which of them ſhall appeare ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, ſhall be the Lord: Fynally, if they be in all poynts alike, then the houſe is preferred before the other dignities, and the exaltation before the triplicitie, the Triplicitie before the tearme, and the tearme before the face, as for example: A queſtion being prepoſed for the daye time: Whoſe aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is the two and twentith degree of Aries, the Lord where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you would know: therefore ſetting your index vppon the 22 degree of Aries, in the Table of dignities aforeſayde,

Now the righte order calleth vs to the ſetting downe of the right Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod &amp; way to bring thinges to their perfite end &amp; ſcope. Therfore we wil now ſhow how many wayes things may be perfitted, the whiche happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth by foure meanes and wayes, that is to ſay, by coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by tranſlation of light and nature, by collection of lighte, and by being in houſes: when as therefore the Lord of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cende<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, the ſignificator of the thing demaunded, be eyther cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally ioyned or by aſpect, the thing demaunded without all doubt ſhall come to paſſe, ſpecially if the coniunction be in the aſcendente. Notwithſtanding it ſhal come to paſſe but with ſome difficultie, if it happen the coniunction to be in the houſe that fignifieth the thing that is demaunded.</p>
               <p>Secondly it is brought to perfection by tranſlation of light and nature, that is when as the ſayde ſignificators are ioyned by coniunction or aſpect, and that ſome other planet doe ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate himſelfe from one of the ſignificators, of whome hee hath bene receiued, and applyeth to the other ſignificator before that hee doth behold or apply vnto any other planet, for then he tranſporteth the force and nature which he tooke of the one vnto the other, and he which receyueth the light, is the author of the perfection of the thing. But when it comes to paſſe in this ſort, he that doth demaund or axe the queſtion doth agree with him for whome it is demaunded, for the ching that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
<pb facs="tcp:14438:33"/> by meanes of ſome man, meſſenger, or iudge, ſent or comming betweene them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, things are brought to paſſe when as there is col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of their light by a planet more waighty then the Lord of the aſcendent or ſignificator of the thing demaunded, that is, when the Lord of the aſcendent and the ſignificator, or the thing demaunded do both behold a planet waightier then the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and ſpeciallye by receptions, for that Planet is as it were iudge that cauſeth the thinges to come vnto intire per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feccion.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, and fynally, thinges are finiſhed by the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Planets in houſes, for if the ſignificators of any thing be in the firſt houſe, ſpecially if they be receyued it doth argue the thing ſhall come to paſſe without any labour. But if the Lord of the horoſcope or the Moone, or any of the ſignificators of the querent be in the houſe of the thing demaunded, it ſhew<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth that it ſhall come to paſſe, but with much labour and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell. Theſe thinges by example ſhalbe made playner, let this therefore be the example. In the yeare of our Lord 1555, the 6 day of Iune, houre 12, minutes 56, there was a queſtion propoſed by one, whether he ſhould get or obtayne any of his brothers goods: at the which houre the figure of the heauen was erected in ſuch ſort as followeth.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14438:33"/>
               <figure/>
               <p>Mercury is here Lord of the aſcendent, and Mars ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator of the thing demaunded, becauſe hee being Lord of the fourth houſe, wherein is contayned the ſubſtaunces of brethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, becauſe it is the ſecond houſe to the third, hee ſhall iuſtlye ſignifie the thing deſired. Now therefore we muſt looke if by any meanes the querent ſhall obtayne or get that whiche hee deſireth. Which thing being conſidered, there appeareth no coniunction betweene the Lord of the aſcendent or the Moone with the ſignificators of the thing demaunded. Wherfore by this meanes the querent ſhall not haue his deſire.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14438:34"/>
               <p>But I doe ſee further a tranſlation of the light and nature of the ſignificator of the thing to be wrought by the moone vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to the Lord of the the horoſcope, for the moone being ſeparate from the trine aſpecte of Mars whome Mars had receyued in his exhaltation, it doth ſhow that the querent ſhall obtayne his deſire more eaſily then if the tranſlation had ben done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe. By the thirde meane whiche is by the collection or gathering of the light it cannot come to paſſe becauſe there is no waightier planet then they that doth behold them both.</p>
               <p>Fourthlye it is like that the thing ſhall come to paſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſignificator of the thing deſired is placed in the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent, therefore wee doe alſo iudge that hee ſhall haue that which he deſireth, becauſe the ſignificator of the thing doeth poſſeſſe the aſcendent, and his light is tranſlated to the Lorde of the horoſcope, in this ſort you ſhall iudge of al maner of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions propounded, alwayes taking heede vnto the diſpoſition of the ſignificators, &amp; marking the good or euil aſpectes, with the fortunate or vnfortunate planets, their applications or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations, For their diſpoſition with the good ſheweth good, and with the euill the contrary, for their application doth ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie inclination, and their ſeparation their priuation. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their applications which are by a trine or ſextill aſpecte doe eaſily bring the thing to paſſe, but thoſe which happeneth by a quadrat or oppoſition, doe cauſe many difficulties. And this ſhall ſuffice to reſolue ſundrie queſtions, notwithſtanding to make this doctrine more eaſie, we wil ſhow an example vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on euery one of the houſes beginning with a queſtion referred vnto the firſt houſe, and ſo proſecute the reſt in order.</p>

For a good election cannot turne away the euil that the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets hath threatned at the time of the natiuitie. Some there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will ſay that elections then doth profite nothing: truelye a good election doth helpe when the ſignificators of the thing in the natiuitie doe helpe the goodneſſe of the election, for if
<pb facs="tcp:14438:44"/> they be good or indifferent good, and not altogether euill, then the election ſhall profite.

But the planet which ſheweth the end of thinges, is the lorde of the fourth houſe, if he be in the fourth houſe or beholde the ſame, otherwiſe it ſhalbe the Lord of the houſe of the Moone, if he doe behold the Moone, or the Moone him, elſe it is the Planet vnto whome the Moone ſhall be firſte corporallye ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or elſe the Lord of the part of fortune, if he doe behold the part, otherwiſe the ſignification thereof remayneth vnto the Moone and her Lord, or to the fourth ſigne from that wherein the Moone is, or as ſome iudge, the Lorde of the fourth ſigne from the part of fortune.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the cheefe poyntes that are to be obſerued in all elections: if all theſe cannot bee framed, you muſt indeauoure to obſerue and keepe as many of them as you may, for the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificator of the thing, the aſcendent, and his Lorde, and the Moone at the leaſt are to be fortified. But if the Moone bee vnfortunate, you ſhall place her falling from the aſcendent, and ſhall chuſe the Planet that doth afflict the Moone, to bee the Lord of the aſcendente, ſo that the Horoſcope being vnder his rule and power, he will not hurt himſelfe, ſo that he be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
<pb facs="tcp:14438:46"/> free from other infortunate aſpects, but if he cannot be lord of the aſcendent, at the leaſt let him rule the tenth, or the eleuenth, or the fifte houſe, and if the Moone bee receyued of that planet, ſhe will doe little hurt or none, for her malice ſhall be abated. Alſo the fortunate planets, as Iupiter and Venus are to be placed in the aſcendent or tenth houſe, or elſe if you can make fortunate the lorde of the houre, it will helpe very much in the matter. Thus we haue briefelye ſhowed what thinges are to be wiſhed and obſerued in all elections, now I will as breefely in few wordes touch what thinges are to be auoyded and taken heede of.</p>

Alſo you muſt not beginne or take in hande anye worke in the time of the coniunction or oppoſition of the two lights, that is at the new or full Moone, ſpecially if it happen with the head or tayle of the Dragon, you muſt take heed that neyther the head or tayle of the Dragon be in the aſcendente, or in the houſe of the thing that is demaunded, or with the part of the thing, for the tayle of the dragon is worſe then the head.
